## Make-A-Video - Pytorch (wip)

Implementation of <a href="https://makeavideo.studio/">Make-A-Video</a>, new SOTA text to video generator from Meta AI, in Pytorch. They combine pseudo-3d convolutions (axial convolutions) and temporal attention and show much better temporal fusion.

The pseudo-3d convolutions isn't a new concept. It has been explored before in other contexts, say for protein contact prediction as <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.04.502748v2.full">"dimensional hybrid residual networks"</a>.
